## Questions

**Basics of ConvNets**

1. What is Computer Vision in general?
2. What is elementary filter to detect vertical/horizontal edges? Write an example.
3. What is the output shape of a matrix (nxn) with filter (fxf) applied?
4. Padding? What problems does it solve?
5. What is the output shape of a matrix (nxn) with filter (fxf) and padding p applied?
6. What the padding value must be to output be the same as input? 
7. What is stride ? What is output size formula for a matrix (nxn) with filter (fxf), padding (p) and stride (s)
8. Tell an example to build one layer of a convolutional network:
