## Questions

**Face recognition & Neural style transfer**

1. What is Face recognition?
2. What is One Shot Learning? 
3. Triplet Loss - how does it work? What is a formula for triplet loss? How do you suppose to choose triplets? 
4. How does learning the similarity function happens? 
5. What is neural style transfer? 
6. What a deep ConvNets are actually learning in each layer? 
7. The cost function for the Neural Style Transfer. Content Cost Function. Style Cost function.
8. Face verification requires comparing a new picture against one person’s face, whereas face recognition requires comparing a new picture against K person’s faces.
9. In order to train the parameters of a face recognition system, it would be reasonable to use a training set comprising 100,000 pictures of 100,000 different persons. Is it true ?
10. You train a ConvNet on a dataset with 100 different classes. You wonder if you can find a hidden unit which responds strongly to pictures of cats. (I.e., a neuron so that, of all the input/training images that strongly activate that neuron, the majority are cat pictures.) You are more likely to find this unit in layer 4 of the network than in layer 1. Is it true ?
11. Neural style transfer is trained as a supervised learning task in which the goal is to input two images (x), and train a network to output a new, synthesized image (y). Is it true ?
12. In the deeper layers of a ConvNet, each channel corresponds to a different feature detector. The style matrix G[l] measures the degree to which the activations of different feature detectors in layer l vary (or correlate) together with each other. Is it true ?
13. In neural style transfer, what is updated in each iteration of the optimization algorithm?
