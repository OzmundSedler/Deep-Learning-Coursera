## Introduction to deep learning

1. **What does the analogy “AI is the new electricity” refer to?**

- Similar to electricity starting about 100 years ago, AI is transforming multiple industries.

2. **Which of these are reasons for Deep Learning recently taking off? (Check the three options that apply.)**

- We have access to a lot more data.
- We have access to a lot more computational power.
- Deep learning has resulted in significant improvements in important applications such as online advertising, speech recognition, and image recognition.

3. **Recall this diagram of iterating over different ML ideas. Which of the statements below are true? (Check all that apply.)**

- Being able to try out ideas quickly allows deep learning engineers to iterate more quickly.
- Faster computation can help speed up how long a team takes to iterate to a good idea.
- Recent progress in deep learning algorithms has allowed us to train good models faster (even without changing the CPU/GPU hardware).

4. **When an experienced deep learning engineer works on a new problem, they can usually use insight from previous problems to train a good model on the first try, without needing to iterate multiple times through different models. True/False?**

- False

5. **Which one of these plots represents a ReLU activation function?**

- Figure 3: 0 for -ve x and constant line with +ve slope for +ve x

6. **Images for cat recognition is an example of “structured” data, because it is represented as a structured array in a computer. True/False?**

- False

7. **A demographic dataset with statistics on different cities' population, GDP per capita, economic growth is an example of “unstructured” data because it contains data coming from different sources. True/False?**

- False

8. **Why is an RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) used for machine translation, say translating English to French? (Check all that apply.)**

- It can be trained as a supervised learning problem.
- It is applicable when the input/output is a sequence (e.g., a sequence of words).

9. **In this diagram which we hand-drew in lecture, what do the horizontal axis (x-axis) and vertical axis (y-axis) represent?**

- x-axis is the amount of data
- y-axis (vertical axis) is the performance of the algorithm.

10. **Assuming the trends described in the previous question's figure are accurate (and hoping you got the axis labels right), which of the following are true? (Check all that apply.)**

- Increasing the size of a neural network generally does not hurt an algorithm’s performance, and it may help significantly.
- Increasing the training set size generally does not hurt an algorithm’s performance, and it may help significantly.
