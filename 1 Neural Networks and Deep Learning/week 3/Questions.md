7. Why do you need random initialization in NN?


## Questions from quiz

8. The tanh activation usually works better than sigmoid activation function for hidden units because the mean of its output is closer to zero, and so it centers the data better for the next layer. True/False?
9. Suppose you have built a neural network. What will happen if you decide to initialize the weights and biases to be zero?
10. You have built a network using the tanh activation for all the hidden units. You initialize the weights to relative large values, using np.random.randn(..,..)*1000. What will happen?
