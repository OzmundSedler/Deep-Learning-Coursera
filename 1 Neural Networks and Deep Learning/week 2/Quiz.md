## Neural Networks Basics

1. **What does a neuron compute?**

- A neuron computes a linear function (z = Wx + b) followed by an activation function

2. **Which of these is the "Logistic Loss"?**

- L(i)(y^(i),y(i))=y(i)log(y^(i))+(1−y(i))log(1−y^(i))

3. **Suppose img is a (32,32,3) array, representing a 32x32 image with 3 color channels red, green and blue. How do you reshape this into a column vector?**
- x = img.reshape((32*32*3,1))

4. **Consider the two following random arrays "a" and "b":**
a = np.random.randn(2, 3) # a.shape = (2, 3)
b = np.random.randn(2, 1) # b.shape = (2, 1)
c = a + b

**What will be the shape of "c"?**

- c.shape = (2, 3)

5. **Consider the two following random arrays "a" and "b":**
a = np.random.randn(4, 3) # a.shape = (4, 3)
b = np.random.randn(3, 2) # b.shape = (3, 2)
c = a*b
**What will be the shape of "c"?**

- The computation cannot happen because the sizes don't match. It's going to be "Error"!

6. **Suppose you have nx input features per example. Recall that X=[x(1)x(2)...x(m)]. What is the dimension of X?**

- (nx,m)

7.  Recall that "np.dot(a,b)" performs a matrix multiplication on a and b, whereas "a*b" performs an element-wise multiplication
Consider the two following random arrays "a" and "b":
a = np.random.randn(12288, 150) # a.shape = (12288, 150)
b = np.random.randn(150, 45) # b.shape = (150, 45)
c = np.dot(a,b)
What is the shape of c?

- c.shape = (12288, 45)

8.**Consider the following code snippet:**
# a.shape = (3,4)
# b.shape = (4,1)
for i in range(3):
  for j in range(4):
    c[i][j] = a[i][j] + b[j]
**How do you vectorize this?**

- c = a + b.T

9. **Consider the following code:**
a = np.random.randn(3, 3)
b = np.random.randn(3, 1)
c = a*b
**What will be c? (If you’re not sure, feel free to run this in python to find out).**

- This will invoke broadcasting, so b is copied three times to become (3,3), and ∗ is an element-wise product so c.shape will be (3, 3)

10. **Consider the following computation graph.
What is the output J?**

- J = (a - 1) * (b + c)
