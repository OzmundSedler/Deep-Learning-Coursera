## Questions

1. How you will build an initial ML system to solve a problem you are not familiar with?
2. Satisficing and optimizing metrics
3. Dev/test sets sizes. Training and testing different distributions - whatâ€™s the problem and how to solve it.
4. Bias and Variance with mismatched data distributions
5. Why comparing to human-level performance? And what exactly is human-level performance?
6. Avoidable Bias - what is it?
7. Gap between Human-level <-> Train Set Error <-> Train-dev Set Error <-> Dev Error
   Ways to avoid Avoidable Bias / Variance / Data mismatch. Explain
8. Error analysis. How will you carry it out?
   For example - cleaning up incorrectly labeled images.
9. Set up dev/test sets and metrics.
   Build an initial system quickly.
   Carry out Bias/Variance analysis and Error analysis to priorit ize the next steps.
   Then iterate. Your comments?
10. Transfer learning concepts. When does it make sense?
11. Multi-task learning concepts. When does it make sense?
