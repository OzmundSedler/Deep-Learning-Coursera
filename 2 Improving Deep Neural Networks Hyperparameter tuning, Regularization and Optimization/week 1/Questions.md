## Questions from quiz
11. If your Neural Network model seems to have high bias, what will you try?
12. You are working on an automated check-out kiosk for a supermarket, and are building a classifier for apples, bananas and oranges. Suppose your classifier obtains a training set error of 0.5%, and a dev set error of 7%. What will you try to improve your classifier?
13. What is weight decay?
14. What happens when you continue to increase the regularization hyperparameter lambda?
15. With the inverted dropout technique, what will you do at test with your NN?
16. Increasing the parameter keep_prob from (say) 0.5 to 0.6 in dropout will likely cause the following:
- ...... the regularization effect
- Causing the neural network to end up with a ... training set error
17. Give examples of techniques useful for reducing variance (reducing overfitting)?
18. Why do we normalize the inputs x?
